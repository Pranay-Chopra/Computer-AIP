          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mt-2" align="justify" style="text-justify:inter-word;">
            AI is relevant to any intellectual task. Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too
            numerous to list here. Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered
            artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the AI effect.<br><br>
            With social media sites overtaking TV as a source for news for young people and news organizations
            increasingly reliant on social media platforms for generating distribution, major publishers now use
            artificial intelligence (AI) technology to post stories more effectively and generate higher volumes of
            traffic.<br><br>
            Artificial Intelligence has various applications in today's society. It is becoming essential for today's
            time because it can solve complex problems with an efficient way in multiple industries, such as Healthcare,
            entertainment, finance, education, etc. AI is making our daily life more comfortable and fast.<br><br>
            Following are some examples of situation where AI is being used now-a-days:<br><br>
            <strong><em>1. AI in Astronomy:</em></strong><br>

            Artificial Intelligence can be very useful to solve complex universe problems. AI technology can be helpful
            for understanding the universe such as how it works, origin, etc.<br><br>

            <strong><em>2. AI in Healthcare:</em></strong><br>

            In the last, five to ten years, AI becoming more advantageous for the healthcare industry and going to have
            a significant impact on this industry.
            Healthcare Industries are applying AI to make a better and faster diagnosis than humans. AI can help doctors
            with diagnoses and can inform when patients are worsening so that medical help can reach to the patient
            before hospitalization.<br><br>

            <strong><em>3. AI in Gaming:</em></strong><br>

            AI can be used for gaming purpose. The AI machines can play strategic games like chess, where the machine
            needs to think of a large number of possible places.<br><br>

            <strong><em>4. AI in Finance:</em></strong><br>

            AI and finance industries are the best matches for each other. The finance industry is implementing
            automation, chatbot, adaptive intelligence, algorithm trading, and machine learning into financial
            processes.<br><br>

            <strong><em>5. AI in Data Security:</em></strong><br>

            The security of data is crucial for every company and cyber-attacks are growing very rapidly in the digital
            world. AI can be used to make your data more safe and secure. Some examples such as AEG bot, AI2
            Platform,are used to determine software bug and cyber-attacks in a better way.<br><br>

            <strong><em>6. AI in Social Media:</em></strong><br>

            Social Media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat contain billions of user profiles, which need to
            be stored and managed in a very efficient way. AI can organize and manage massive amounts of data. AI can
            analyze lots of data to identify the latest trends, hashtag, and requirement of different users.<br><br>

            <strong><em>7. AI in Travel & Transport:</em></strong><br>

            AI is becoming highly demanding for travel industries. AI is capable of doing various travel related works
            such as from making travel arrangement to suggesting the hotels, flights, and best routes to the customers.
            Travel industries are using AI-powered chatbots which can make human-like interaction with customers for
            better and fast response.<br><br>

            <strong><em>8. AI in Automotive Industry:</em></strong><br>

            Some Automotive industries are using AI to provide virtual assistant to their user for better performance.
            Such as Tesla has introduced TeslaBot, an intelligent virtual assistant.
            Various Industries are currently working for developing self-driven cars which can make your journey more
            safe and secure.<br><br>

            <strong><em>9. AI in Robotics:</em></strong><br>

            Artificial Intelligence has a remarkable role in Robotics. Usually, general robots are programmed such that
            they can perform some repetitive task, but with the help of AI, we can create intelligent robots which can
            perform tasks with their own experiences without pre-programmed.
            Humanoid Robots are best examples for AI in robotics, recently the intelligent Humanoid robot named as Erica
            and Sophia has been developed which can talk and behave like humans.<br><br>

            <strong><em>10. AI in Entertainment:</em></strong><br>
