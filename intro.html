          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mt-2" align="justify" style="text-justify:inter-word;">
            Artificial intelligence (AI), is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence
            displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents":
            any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully
            achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines
            (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as
            "learning" and "problem solving".<br><br>

            As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from
            the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI is
            whatever hasn't been done yet." For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from
            things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology. Modern machine capabilities generally
            classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in
            strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in
            content delivery networks, and military simulations.<br><br>

            Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has
            experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as
            an "AI winter"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.[13][16] After AlphaGo
            successfully defeated a professional Go player in 2015, artificial intelligence once again attracted
            widespread global attention. For most of its history, AI research has been divided into sub-fields that
            often fail to communicate with each other. These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such
            as particular goals (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"), the use of particular tools ("logic" or
            artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences. Sub-fields have also been based
            on social factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers).<br><br>

            The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning,
            learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.
            General intelligence is among the field's long-term goals. Approaches include statistical methods,
            computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI. Many tools are used in AI, including versions of
            search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics,
            probability and economics. The AI field draws upon computer science, information engineering, mathematics,
            psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.<br><br>

            The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a
            machine can be made to simulate it". This raises philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethics
            of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence. These issues have been explored by myth,
            fiction and philosophy since antiquity. Some people also consider AI to be a danger to humanity if it
            progresses unabated. Others believe that AI, unlike previous technological revolutions, will create
            a risk of mass unemployment.<br><br>

            In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in
            computer power, large amounts of data, and theoretical understanding; and AI techniques have become an
            essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science,
            software engineering and operations research.
